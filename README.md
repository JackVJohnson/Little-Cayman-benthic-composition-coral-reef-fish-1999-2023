# True-role-of-fish-for-coral-reef-health

Code runs sequentially 

Use data folders titled “fish” “benthic” “recruits” to run code 1. 

Use “Data_tidy” folder for codes 2 and 3

Use “TIDY_COMPLETE” for codes 4-9. Analysis starts in code 4.

I hope someone smarter than me can make better use of these data than I have! 😊
